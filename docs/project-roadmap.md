## Technical Considerations

### Data Management
- Store raw data separately from processed data
- Create reproducible preprocessing pipelines
- Document any data augmentation techniques

### Training Infrastructure
- Use GPU acceleration if available
- Consider gradient accumulation for larger batch sizes on limited hardware
- Save model checkpoints at regular intervals
- Log training metrics (consider using TensorBoard or W&B)

### Evaluation Metrics
- Primary: Accuracy, F1-score
- Secondary: Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix for error analysis

### Model Interpretability
- Attention visualization for selected examples
- LIME or SHAP analysis for model explainability (optional extension)

## Extensions (If Time Permits)
- Implement model distillation to create a smaller, faster version
- Explore few-shot learning approaches
- Compare with non-transformer baselines (CNN, LSTM)
- Deploy model to a simple web application for demo purposes
